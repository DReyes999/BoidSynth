# BoidSynth
 A procedural synthesizer instrument played with a flock of boids
 
 The name "boid" corresponds to a shortened version of "bird-oid object", which refers to a bird-like object which follows a pattern of behaviors that result in flocking. These flocking behaviors were developed by Craig Reynolds in 1986.
 
 The Boidsynth is a WIP developed in Unity version 2018.2.4f1. The program creates a flock of boids and uses their behavior to drive a synthesizer plugin built in PureData. 
 
 To run, clone or download the project and open it in Unity 2018.2.4f1 or later. Press play.
